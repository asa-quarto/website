# Anatomy of a Quarto project

## Quarto projects

-   Quarto projects have a `_quarto.yml` file

-   The `type` field in this file indicates the type of project:

    -   `default`: Collection of documents

    -   `website`: Websites (and blogs)

    -   `books`: Books ðŸ˜ƒ

## Our turn

::: our-turn
Let's build a website together from all of the documents we've created so far and highlight the following features of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page

-   Navigation: `left` and `right` under `navbar`; `contents` under `sidebar`.

-   Themes and dark theme toggle

-   Publishing: `quarto publish`

## Our turn: Code snippets

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}

Go back to the project in `3a-websites`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick up where we left off and

-   Add an [about page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).
-   Look at the [`_quarto.yml` for the workshop site](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/quarto-jsm24/blob/main/_quarto.yml). Find something you like and add it to your site.

# Wrap up

## Freeze {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   The `freeze` option controls when/if computational documents be re-rendered during a global project render:

    -   

        ``` yaml
           execute:
             freeze: true # never re-render during project render
        ```

    -   

        ``` yaml
           execute:
             freeze: auto  # re-render when source file changes
        ```

    -   

        ``` yaml
          execute:
            freeze: false  # always re-render
        ```

-   The `freeze` option is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory.

-   For blogs, set `freeze` in `_metadata.yml` at the root of the `posts` directory.

-   You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.
:::

## Freeze vs. cache

-   Cache stores the results of computations for a specific file.

-   Cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined).

-   `cache` can also be set at the chunk level.
    Consider using the cache for computationally expensive chunks.

## Publishing

See <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing> for publishing options other than Quarto Pub.

# Books

## Quarto books

-   Books and websites are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

::: columns
::: column
Website

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website: 
  navbar:
    left:
      - index.qmd
      - hello-penguins.qmd
```
:::

::: column
Book

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: book

book: 
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - hello-penguins.qmd
```
:::
:::

## Our turn

::: our-turn
Let's build a book together from all of the documents we've created so far and highlight the following features of Quarto books:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page / change landing page

-   Add a PDF version

-   Cross references

-   Sections
:::

## Your turn

::: your-turn

Launch the project in `3b-books`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pick up where we left off and

-   Give a [title](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html#overview) to your book.
-   Try [dividing the chapters in to Parts](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html#parts-appendices)
-   Cross reference a figure (e.g. the one in `tables-figures.qmd`) from another chapter.
