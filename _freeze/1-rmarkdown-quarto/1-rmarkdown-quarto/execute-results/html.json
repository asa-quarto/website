Consistent with this commitment, it is the policy of the ASA that all participants in ASA activities enjoy a welcoming environment free from unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n\n::: aside\n[ASA Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/code-of-conduct)\n:::\n\n## Expected Behavior {.smaller}\n\n- Model and support the norms of respect necessary to promote the conditions for healthy exchange of scientific ideas.\n\n- In speech or conduct, do not insult or disparage other participants.\n\n- Be conscious of hierarchical structures, specifically the existence of stark power differentials between students, early career statisticians and established career statisticians—noting that fear of retaliation from more established statisticians can make it difficult for students and early career statisticians to express discomfort, rebuff unwelcome advances, and report violations of the conduct policy.\n\n- Be sensitive to indications that may suggest that individuals are feeling unwelcome.\n\n::: aside\n[ASA Code of Conduct](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/code-of-conduct)\n:::\n\n## About me\n\n**Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel**\n\n-   Professor of the Practice\\\n    Department of Statistical Science\\\n    Duke University\n-   Developer Educator\\\n    Posit, PBC\n-   R Markdown user for 11+ years\\\n-   Quarto user for 2+ years\n\n## About you\n\n::: task\nPlease share:\n\n- Name\n- Professional affiliation\n- What do you want to use Quarto for?\n\nOr if you know everyone around you -- Are you good with setup steps?\n:::\n\n\n\n\n{{< countdown minutes=2 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Meeting you where you are\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\nThese materials are pitched at someone who:\n\n-   knows some R + Markdown\n\n-   has worked in RStudio\n\n-   wants to learn about Quarto\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n::: {.fragment .fade-in}\nI'll **teach** you\n\n-   More Markdown\n\n-   New Quarto formats\n\n-   New Quarto projects\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Workshop structure\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"33%\"}\n**My turn**\n\n-   Lecture segments\n-   Feel free to just watch, take notes, browse docs, or tinker around with the code\n:::\n\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"33%\"}\n::: our-turn\n**Our turn**\n\n-   Lecture segments + live coding\n-   (Optionally) follow along with live coding\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"33%\"}\n::: your-turn\n**Your turn**\n\n-   Practice exercises for you\n-   Work on your own or with the person next to you\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Checking in one more time {.smaller}\n\n::: task\n\n**1.
