1.  Create a 3 row x 2 col table, populate with a column for restaurant + column for cuisine, and then add 3 examples. Then, cross reference it from text.

See @tbl-restaurants for some restaurants I like:

| Restaurant         | Cuisine  |
|--------------------|----------|
| Block15            | Pub food |
| La Rockita         | Mexican  |
| Queen's Chopsticks | Chinese  |

: Restaurants {#tbl-restaurants}

2.  Include the R logo and the Quarto logo from the `images/` folder as subfigures of a single figure.

::: {#fig-logos layout-ncol=2}

![R Logo](images/r-logo.png)

![Quarto Logo](images/quarto-logo.png)

2.  Add a figure generated from code and cross reference it.

Adelie penguins are the most prevalent in this data (@fig-species).

```{r}
#| label: fig-species
#| fig-cap: "Prevalance of three species in the data"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE)
```
